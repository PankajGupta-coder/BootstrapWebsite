           <h1> Step 1: Create a GitHub account </h1>

            The easiest way to get started is to create an account on GitHub.com (it's free).

            git_guide1.png
            Create a GitHub account

            Pick a username (e.g., octocat123), enter your email address and a password, and click Sign up for GitHub.
            Once
            you are in, it will look something like this:

            git_guide2.png
            Signed in to GitHub
            <h1>Step 2: Create a new repository </h1>

            A repository is like a place or a container where something is stored; in this case we're creating a Git
            repository to store code. To create a new repository, select New Repository from the + sign dropdown menu
            (you
            can see I've selected it in the upper-right corner in the image above).

            git_guide3.png
            Create a new repository

            Enter a name for your repository (e.g, "Demo") and click Create Repository. Don't worry about changing any
            other
            options on this page.

            Congratulations! You have set up your first repo on GitHub.com.
          <h1>  Step 3: Create a file </h1>

            Once your repo is created, it will look like this:

            git_guide4.png
            New repo on GitHub

            Don't panic, it's simpler than it looks. Stay with me. Look at the section that starts "...or create a new
            repository on the command line," and ignore the rest for now.

            Open the Terminal program on your computer.

            git_guide5.png
            Terminal

            Type git and hit Enter. If it says command bash: git: command not found, then install Git with the command
            for
            your Linux operating system or distribution. Check the installation by typing git and hitting Enter; if it's
            installed, you should see a bunch of information about how you can use the command.

            In the terminal, type:

            mkdir Demo

            This command will create a directory (or folder) named Demo.

            Change your terminal to the Demo directory with the command:

            cd Demo

            Then enter:

            echo "#Demo" >> README.md

            This creates a file named README.md and writes #Demo in it. To check that the file was created successfully,
            enter:

            cat README.md

            This will show you what is inside the README.md file, if the file was created correctly. Your terminal will
            look
            like this:

            git_guide7.png
            Terminal

            To tell your computer that Demo is a directory managed by the Git program, enter:

            git init

            Then, to tell the Git program you care about this file and want to track any changes from this point
            forward,
            enter:

            git add README.md

            What is an IDE?

            So far you've created a file and told Git about it, and now it's time to create a commit. Commit can be
            thought
            of as a milestone. Every time you accomplish some work, you can write a Git commit to store that version of
            your
            file, so you can go back later and see what it looked like at that point in time. Whenever you make a change
            to
            your file, you create a new version of that file, different from the previous one.

            To make a commit, enter:

            git commit -m "first commit"

            That's it! You just created a Git commit and included a message that says first commit. You must always
            write a
            message in commit; it not only helps you identify a commit, but it also enables you to understand what you
            did
            with the file at that point. So tomorrow, if you add a new piece of code in your file, you can write a
            commit
            message that says, Added new code, and when you come back in a month to look at your commit history or Git
            log
            (the list of commits), you will know what you changed in the files.
            <h1>Step 5: Connect your GitHub repo with your  computer </h1>

            Now, it's time to connect your computer to GitHub with the command:

            git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_username>/Demo.git

                Let's look at this command step by step. We are telling Git to add a remote called origin with the
                address
                https://github.com/<your_username>/Demo.git (i.e., the URL of your Git repo on GitHub.com). This allows
                    you
                    to interact with your Git repository on GitHub.com by typing origin instead of the full URL and Git
                    will
                    know where to send your code. Why origin? Well, you can name it anything else if you'd like.

                    Now we have connected our local copy of the Demo repository to its remote counterpart on GitHub.com.
                    Your terminal looks like this:

                    git_guide8.png
                    Terminal

                    Now that we have added the remote, we can push our code (i.e., upload our README.md file) to
                    GitHub.com.

                    Once you are done, your terminal will look like this:

                    git_guide9.png
                    Terminal

                    And if you go to https://github.com/<your_username>/Demo you will see something like this:

                        git_guide10.png
                        Demo repo on GitHub

                        That's it! You have created your first GitHub repo, connected it to your computer, and pushed
                        (or
                        uploaded) a file from your computer to your repository called Demo on GitHub.com. Next time, I
                        will
                        write about Git cloning (downloading your code from GitHub to your computer), adding new files,
                        modifying existing files, and pushing (uploading) files to GitHub.
